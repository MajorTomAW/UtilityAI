## Artificial Psychology

---

We start by defining the difference between agents and players.
- Agents don't really have psychology
- But players do have psychology

So how can we leverage our players' innate psychology to create the illusion of it in our agents?

## Player Psychology

### Prisoner's Dilemma
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a standard example of a game theory problem.  
It demonstrates why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so.

### Kuleshov Effect
The Kuleshov Effect is a film editing effect that demonstrates how the same image can evoke different emotions depending on the context in which it is presented.  
In the absence of any defining information, people project what they believe should be there.
